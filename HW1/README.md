Homework: Vector

Created a small Vector class that can expand its size and deep copy

Did the following tests in main:
push_back with 1000+ ints

operator[] in action

size() for loop bounds

assignment (showing deep!)

copy constructor (showing deep!)


All warnings were cleaned up so it ran successfully (do ./test after making the executable and it'll print out the sizing and current capacity, 1st Vector, 2nd Vector
that's assigned the 1st Vector, and a copy 1st Vector)
